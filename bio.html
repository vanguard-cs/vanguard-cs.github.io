    <h1>about me:</h1>
    <p>I'm a rare mix of business and cybersecurity—someone who understands both how companies operate and how to protect them. With a marketing degree and a cybersecurity Masters, I bring a unique perspective that helps bridge the gap between security teams and business leaders.<br><br> 
        
    I’ve worked as a corporate marketing coordinator, so I get strategy, stakeholder management, and communication. But I’m also a cybersecurity-trained analyst, diving into penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and ethical hacking. That means I don’t just find security issues—I know how to explain them in a way that decision-makers understand and act on.<br><br>
        
    On top of that, I'm a highly skilled autodidact who thrives on learning, whether it's through formal training or competing in Hack The Box CTFs. And practicing Bujitsu? That's given me discipline, focus, and the ability to remain calm under fire.<br><br>
        
    For any recruiter looking for someone who’s technical, business-savvy, and a fast learner, I might be your next hire.<br><br></p>
        
    <h1>Key Strengths:</h1>
    <p>* Cybersecurity Expertise: In-depth knowledge of network security, web application vulnerabilities, and ethical hacking techniques. Currently pursuing CEH certification to further enhance my skills.<br>
    * CTF Competitions: Active participant in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges on Hack the Box, continually refining my skills in real-world cyber threat scenarios.<br>
    * Business & Marketing Insight: A background in business and marketing enables me to understand the broader organizational impact of cybersecurity solutions, bridging the gap between technical and business stakeholders.<br>
    * Service Industry Experience: Years of experience in the service industry have honed my ability to excel in high-pressure environments, communicate effectively with diverse teams, and deliver exceptional customer service.<br><br></p>
        
    <h1>What I Offer:</h1>
    
    <p>I bring a creative and inquisitive approach to solving complex cybersecurity challenges. I have a passion for continuous learning and I am dedicated to professional development—whether through CTF competitions, hands-on testing, or gaining new certifications. I am a strong team player, and my business background in corporate marketing has allowed me to hone my skills in stakeholder communication</p>
